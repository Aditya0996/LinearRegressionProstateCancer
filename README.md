# LinearRegressionProstateCancer-
This project applies Linear Regression to the Prostate Cancer dataset. First, we work with the least squares. Then we investigate regression using L2 (Ridge) and L1 (Lasso) regularization. Finally, we implement an iterative version of L2 Regularization using gradient descent and coordinate descent.
