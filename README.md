# LinearRegressionProstateCancer
This project applies Linear Regression to the Prostate Cancer dataset. First, we work with the least squares. Then we investigate regression using L2 (Ridge) and L1 (Lasso) regularization. Finally, we implement an iterative version of L2 Regularization using gradient descent and coordinate descent.

## Project Overview
The Prostate Cancer dataset includes several clinical measurements for prostate cancer patients. The target variable `lpsa` is a logarithmic measure of prostate-specific antigen. This project involves:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Implementation (Linear Regression)
4. Model Evaluation
5. Insights and Conclusion

## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
